# Orbital SoC Documentation

Welcome to OrbitalFPGA's Soft SoC project, a public open-source effort to design, implement and document a fully custom RISC-V based soft SoC platform for FPGAs. This repo serces as the centerl documentation hub for the project. 

## ðŸŒŒ Project Goals
* Build a completely custom soft SoC based on the RV32I RISC-V core.
* Interconnect all IP blocks via the Wishbone B4 bus standard.
* Create a working toolchain and development environment.

## ðŸ”§ Components
This project consists of multiple modular IP blocks. Each block lives in its own dedicated GitHub repository. A summary of each block can be found in the `docs/` folder with full documentation found in the respective repository. 

The following are the planned components
* Wishbone B4 Servent Interface
* First-In-First-Out
* UART
* GPIO
* Programmable timer
* RV32I Processor
* Memory controllers
